            Go is a very complex game, and it is not solved. 
            There are many different strategies that can be used, and it is very difficult to determine which is the best. 
            The game is played on a 19x19 board, and each player has 180 stones. 
            The goal of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent. 
            The game is played by placing stones on the board, and the stones are removed from the 
            board when a player captures them. The game ends when both players pass, 
            and the player with the most territory wins. In 2016, AlphaGo beat the world champion in Go, setting precident
            for the most advanced game playing AI.
