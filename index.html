        <h2>About Game Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Game theory is a branch of mathematics that concerns the ways in which interacting choices of 
            characters produce outcomes with respect to the preferences (or utilities) of those characters, 
            where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the characters.
            A few examples of games that might be analyzed using game theory include 
            <a href="School-GameTheory-Website-master\TicTacToe.html">Tic-tac-toe</a>, 
            <a href="School-GameTheory-Website-master\Checker.html">Checkers</a>, 
            and <a href="School-GameTheory-Website-master\Go.html">Go</a>.
            Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, 
            as well as logic and computer science.
