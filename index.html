        <h2>About Game Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Game theory is a branch of mathematics that concerns the ways in which interacting choices of 
            characters produce outcomes with respect to the preferences (or utilities) of those characters, 
            where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the characters.
            A few examples of games that might be analyzed using game theory include 
            <a href="TicTacToe.html">Tic-tac-toe</a>, 
            <a href="Checkers.html">Checkers</a>, 
            and <a href="Go.html">Go</a>.
            Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, 
            as well as logic and computer science.

        <h2>Some Basic Concepts</h2>
        <h3> Solved Game </h3>
        <p>
            A solved game is a game whose outcome (win, lose or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. 
            This concept is usually applied to abstract strategy games, and especially to games with full information and no element of chance;
            solving such a game may use combinatorial game theory and/or computer assistance.
        </p>
        <h3> Perfect and imperfect information </h3>
        <p>
             A game is one of perfect information if all players, at every move in the game, know the moves previously made by all other players.
             An imperfect information game is played when the players do not know all moves already made by the opponent such as a simultaneous move game.
             Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games.
             Examples of perfect-information games include tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess, and Go.
             Many card games are games of imperfect information, such as poker and bridge.
        </p>
        <h3>Zero-sum games</h3>
        <p>
          Zero-sum games (more generally, constant-sum games) are games in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. 
          In zero-sum games, the total benefit goes to all players in a game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, 
          a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).Poker exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), 
          because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. 
          Other zero-sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including Go and chess.
          Many games studied by game theorists 
          (including the famed prisoner's dilemma) are non-zero-sum games, because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero.
          Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.
